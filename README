This is (will be!) a Cppcheck plugin for Qt Creator.

It will run Cppcheck for the project (and/or files) open in Qt Creator.

To build this plugin you'll need:
- Qt creator 2.0.1 sources (and Qt Creator compiled)
- Qt 4.7.0 or later

Set environment variables:
- QTC_SOURCE: path to QT Creator sources
- QTC_BUILD: path where Qt Creator is build

Then just run qmake and make
- qmake ; make

The plugin is installed to Qt Creator plugins directory (in Nokia-directory).
Start the Qt Creator and plugin should be listed in Help / About Plugins.

Note that there is nothing Qt Creator version specific (yet) in this plugin. So
it works with 2.0 and later versions by changing the version numbers to
Cppcheck.pluginspec -file.
